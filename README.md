# Django TodoApp
This is my first project in Django, using a local database. 
The project contains a graphical interface,
which allows you to create "Tasks" and delete them and/or mark them as "finished" or "not finished."

# Settings
- In the settins.py file in the django todoapp folder, you have to put the data of the database that you are willing to use
- Once you have inserted your database data, use the py -m manage migrate command to update the data.
- Finally, use the command py -m manage runserver to run the project.


# Versions
Django: (5, 0, 2, 'final', 0)
Python: 3.11
